# About project

POSTPONED UNTIL SUMMER 2026!

This repository contains my "Optimization of Plant Growth on Urban Terraces Using Embedded Devices" home project.

The project is developed in ESP-IDF and builds on an ESP32-S3 N16R8 with multiple sensors such as VEML7700, BME280 etc. Documentation is written in LaTeX.
